  <img src="images/rob.jpg" height="200" width="250" align="left" class="wrapped"> Traveling to different places both in and out of the U.S. has always been a passion of mine and I was fortunate to be able to do this from a young age. One of the reasons this was possible was due to company trips my dad was invited to on a regular basis. One of the first trips I ever remember taking was to Hawaii when I was in fourth grade. Other than the 12 hour plane ride at a young age the entire experience was a blast. Since then I have been numerous places both my family and with friends.

<h3>Utimate Destination - The Bahamas</h3>
<p>My most recent trip was last March when I went to Paradise Island in the Bahamas. Now I have been there several times before, but everytime I go it never seems like a long enough stay. Usually when I go to the Bahamas we stay at the Atlantis Resort, but the last time was just a guys trip and we ended up staying at a place called The Cove which is an adults only hotel. </p>
