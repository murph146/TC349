	The Vimeo website is one of the first sites we have reviewed that I am somewhat familiar with and I periodically visit the site to view or download videos. I think upon a first glance that most people would consider the Vimeo site is similar to what YouTube offers. One thing I don’t like about the home page is the background at the top and bottom which seems like it would be appropriate for a website for children. The site was created by a group of filmmakers and I think it’s pretty evident due to the animation, design, and quality graphics that are seen throughout the site.  As I mentioned in a previous review I really like it when sites use different CSS transitions and I like that the designers took advantage of this for the “Explore” and “Help” pages, among other areas.
