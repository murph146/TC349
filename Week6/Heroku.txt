       I was pretty intrigued by the Heroku website when I first looked at it because of the design and the mention of a cloud platform. One of the first things I noticed was the use of unique icons to go along with the text on many of their buttons. The other thing that caught my eye on the homepage was that the software/hardware can be used with Git, which is a service we are currently using for our class. The overall layout was quite user-friendly and I enjoyed using the buttons on the “How it Works” page to click through the different components of the service. Having the diagram helped with visualizing the layout of the components as well. 
       The other interactive feature that was helpful was on the “pricing” page.  Up to this point I had no idea what a web or worker dyno was, therefore the description and the slider were very helpful in seeing the increased cost that come with adding on more of either type of dyno. As for the color scheme I found it very appealing and even though they made use of dark colors throughout most of the site it was still very readable. I personally like it when websites make good use of interactive elements or different transitions when it comes to webpage design and functionality. Ultimately I think everything was laid out pretty nicely and the organization seemed appropriate. Prior to visiting the site I only had a basic understanding of a cloud platform, but after spending some time exploring the site I have a better idea of what exactly is involved.
