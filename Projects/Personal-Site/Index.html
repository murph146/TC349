<h1>Rob Murphy's Homepage </h1>
<br>
<p> <img src="images/016.jpg" alt="Profile Pic" width="250" height="200" id="pic" class="wrapped"> Hi, my name is Rob Murphy and the reason I created this site is to give you a closer look at who I am and some of the things I enjoy doing. I am currently a senior at Michigan State University and will be graduating this December with a degree in Media and Communications Technology (MCT). Along with my degree I also chose to specialize in Information and Communication Technology (ICT).
<p>Along with going to college, I also work for the <a href="http://www.vps.msu.edu">Office of the Vice-President for Student Affairs and Services</a> which is located at the Student Services building on campus. In my free time I enjoy a wide arrange of activities and sports, as well as spending time with my family. I also enjoy traveling to a number of different places in and out of the United States.
<p>I have broken the site down into several different areas and they are as follows:
<ul class="one">
  <li>My Portfolio</li>
  <li>Hobbies</li>
  <li>Favorite Destinations</li>
</ul>
If you would like more information on the degree I am currently finishing you can visit the <a href="http://www.reg.msu.edu/AcademicPrograms/ProgramDetail.asp?Program=1460"> MSU Website</a> and if you have any questions for me feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:murph146@msu.edu?subject=Feedback" >Murph146@msu.edu</a>
