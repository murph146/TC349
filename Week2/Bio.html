  <h2> Webpage Critique</h2>
  <p> Upon taking a first look at <a href="http://www.panic.com/">www.panic.com</a> I was a little disappointed that the software they make is only for Macs, iPads, or iPhones because it looks like the software would be quite useful. That aside the home page is very clean looking and the icons and images are extremely vivid. I like that they had several links at the bottom for requesting help and downloading previous versions of their software. The one thing that wasn’t on the homepage that I would have like to see is an email address link for contacting them directly.  Also I did not see any links to page that’s tell me more about the company and possibly its employees. </p>
	<p> After viewing the homepage I checked out the pages for each of the pieces of software they make. They all seemed nicely put together except for the last piece of software called “Prompt.” On this particular page there was really only a link for downloading the software on the app store and then some frequently asked questions. Other than that, I liked that on each of the individual software pages the links for downloading or purchasing the software were easy to find. While there were a couple screenshots on certain pages, I don’t know how relevant they were. It would have been nice to be able to view a number of screenshots from different key areas of each program. Overall, it looks like a nice site and if I knew someone with a Mac in need of similar software I would recommend the page.
