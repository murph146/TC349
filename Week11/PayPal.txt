       The mobile version website I chose to review this week was mobile.PayPal.com which is pretty well known.  I primarily use this site to check my account balances after buying or selling items on eBay. Along with the website there is also an iPhone application that you can download if you don’t like using the website.  I think the mobile version of the site leaves a lot to be desired, but this may be due to the fact that they felt people would prefer to download the application instead. Regardless, due to the popularity of PayPal I would think they would want to model the mobile site off the initial one using a responsive design. 
       The first thing that appears on the mobile site is a big button for downloading the PayPal application. Moving down the page you have several links to primary tasks that people use the site for, a link on using a PIN for logging in, and then a link about the website itself. One link that is definitely missing from this list is “Request Money.” On the regular PayPal site this link is included in the main navigation tabs across the top the page and is a primary feature of the PayPal service.  For the most part the mobile site functions as it should, however, it’s plain looking and very unattractive. The only other explanation for this I can come up with is that maybe if people see how limited the mobile site is they will chose to use the application instead. It’s my personal opinion that due to the poor quality of the mobile site they should get rid of it because it is a poor reflection on the company.
