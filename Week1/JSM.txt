	Upon looking at the website http://jasonsantamaria.com my first impression was that it's pretty organized and very clean looking. One of the first things I noticed on the homepage were the links to articles and the day they were added. By looking at the dates on the homepage, it seems that the site it updated quite frequently which tells me that keep a flow of new content is important to the owner. I also like that there was a video can watch and not just a bunch of articles. I think that having a good mix of media on a webpage is important because it keeps the person viewing the page interested.
	The next thing I focused on was the tabs at the top of the page which broke the site down into five main areas. Within the "articles" tab it was nice to be able to filter the articles by category. One of the drawback of the site was that the "portfolio" tab was not yet completed. Personally, I think the porfolio would be a priority if you interested in getting your work in from of people. Also, it was nice seeing the option to buy the different books listed on the "readings" tabs. Many times you see products advertised on websites, but there are no links to buy the item and instead you have to do a search for it on the web.
