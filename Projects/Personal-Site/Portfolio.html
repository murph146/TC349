 For the past seven years I have been working in the IT industry in both management and assistant positions. But I first got interested in computers back in the late 90s when Windows 3.11 came out. I was extremely fascinated at how these machines could do all these tasks and display them in  a visually appealing format rather than just text or lines of code. Ever since then I have always enjoyed taking apart computers, building them, and fixing them.

<h2>Recent Jobs</h2>
<ol>
  <li> As I mentioned on my homepage my most recent job has been at the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs and Services. I was really lucky to get this job during my junior year because I didn't apply for an internship during the summer due to taking class. So far I have learned a lot of new things in a short amount of time and all of these will be great additions to my resume. Some of my daily activities at work are: </li>
</ol>
<ul class="one">
  <li><em>providing end user support for 300+ staff and students from 13 different departments around campus</em></li>
  <li><em>Building new computers and migrating software and files from old machines to new machines</em></li>
  <li><em>hardware and software troubleshooting of supported desktops and laptops</em></li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li value="2">My second most recent job was working for UBS Financial Services in Birmingham, Michigan as an IT Manager and Customer Service Associate. This was definitely one of the jobs I enjoyed the most and one that carried a lot of responsibility with it. The job entailed numerous different technologies and required me to support it on a daily basis. I was also responsible for doing the same thing at 5 other office locations around Michigan. Listed below is a more specific lists of the actual tasks I preformed. </li>
