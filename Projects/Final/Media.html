  <h1>Cool R/C Helicopter Pictures & Videos</h1>
  <p class="content">This is by far my favorite page of the entire site and hopefully yours too. I personally am not an expert when it comes to flying r/c helicopters and therefore I really enjoy watching true masters of the hobby. As you'll see flying r/c helicopters are quite a big deal and there is a huge following. Just like with sports, there are numerous r/c helicopter competitions where the best come out to show off their skill. Many of the top hobbyist also receive sponorship from the big manufacturers of r/c helicopters and parts.</p>
