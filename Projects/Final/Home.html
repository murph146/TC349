  <h1 align="center">R/C Helicopter Guide</h1>
  <p> Welcome to guide about remote control helicopters. Several years I began to take an interest in learning to build and fly r/c helicopters and have turned it into a personal hobby. I initally got into the r/c hobby back when I was in high school after my parents got me one for Christmas. At the time I didn't even realize how big the r/c industry was and the number of different kinds of r/c devices you can purchase.</p>
  <P>Now all this talk about r/c toys might have you thinking of the r/c cars or boats you got as a present when you were a kid, but I can assure you these are nothing like that. The majority of these type of helicopters are extremely powerful and have the ability to inflict serious damange on a person or animal if the proper precautions aren't taken.
