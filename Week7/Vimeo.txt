	The Vimeo website is one of the first sites we have reviewed that I am somewhat familiar with and I periodically visit the site to view or download videos. I think upon a first glance that most people would consider the Vimeo site is similar to what YouTube offers. One thing I don’t like about the home page is the background at the top and bottom which seems like it would be more appropriate for a website catering to younger kids. The site was created by a group of filmmakers and I think it’s pretty evident due to the animation, design, and quality graphics that are seen throughout the site.  As I mentioned in a previous review I really like it when sites use different CSS transitions and I like that the designers took advantage of this for the “Explore” and “Help” pages, among other areas. 
	Overall, I think this site is more complex than some of the other sites we have reviewed prior to this one. I would say this is primarily due to the type and amount of content being offered on the site. This being said I think the site is organized nicely and everything is pretty accessible, but I expected this due to the popularity of the site.  For first time users of the site having the “What can you do here?” section is helpful and is a great way to get people interested in the different things you can do with the site.  Another thing that is helpful in getting new users signed up is that only a little amount of information is required to get signed up.  Finally, I like that the site has a couple different account options such as Vimeo Plus and Vimeo Pro. Both of these options provide a different range of services and storage depending on the user’s need. Being that the plus and pro versions charge a fee for using them I would expect this page is a big part of their business strategy.
