  <p> Traveling to different places both in and out of the U.S. has always been a passion of mine and I was fortunate to be able to do this from a young age. One of the reasons this was possible was due to company trips my dad was invited to on a regular basis. One of the first trips I ever remember taking was to Hawaii when I was in fourth grade. Other than the 12 hour plane ride at a young age the entire experience was a blast. Since then I have been numerous places with my family and with friends.</p>

  <h2>Ultimate Destination - The Bahamas</h2>
  <p> My most recent trip was last March when I went to Paradise Island in the Bahamas. Now I have been there several times before, but everytime I go it never seems like a long enough stay. Usually when I go to the Bahamas we stay at the Atlantis Resort, but the last time was just a guys trip and we ended up staying at a place called <a href="http://thecoveatlantis.com/"> The Cove </a>which is an adults only hotel. The nice thing about this hotel is that there are no kids running around and everything is centered around an adult atmosphere. However if youâ€™re looking for a little more excitement, the Atlantis Resort is close enough to walk to. There you can go on the 50 foot water slide among other things or walk to the beach and rent a number of different wave runners. </p>
