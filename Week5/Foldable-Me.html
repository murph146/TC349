  <p>To begin the card sorting process I created rows which represent the main pages of the site. From there I created index cards containing the page names and the main content within those pages and placed them in the appropriate order as viewed on the website. The very first picture is the organization of the site as I originally viewed it. Upon doing my own sort I felt that a couple changes should be made. As you can see when I organized the site I put things in a little different order and this can be seen in the second picture. First I felt that the order of the main pages should be in the following order: <em>home, create, blog, about, contact.</em> Second I felt that the fun video on building the &quot;foldable me&quot; characters belonged on the &quot;create&quot; page instead of the &quot;about&quot; page. Other than the couple changes I suggested I think the site was organized pretty well and the changes I mentioned were minor in my opinion. This is the first time I have done a card sorting exercise so there may not be the usual amount of detail, but overall I can see the value in using this when building a new site or modifying an exisitng one. </p>
  <p> After I ran through the sorting once myself, I had a friend run though it also. They way he organized the site can be seen in the third picture. He felt that the order of the main pages should remain the same as the original, however he felt that the fun video on building the  &quot;foldable me&quot; characters should be on the &quot;create&quot; page. In respect to the video him and I agreed about the different placement of the video. I didn't have anyone else to do another card sort at this time, but between the two of us I think we can up with some possible changes for that will better the overall navigation of the site. </p>
