	Before initially viewing a new website like United Pixelworkers I always try and guess what the site might be about. I assumed it might be an actual Union, however after reading more about the site I found out that the idea is basically paying homage to the United Steelworkers. Regardless, I like the idea of a place where designers and developers can come together and be represented and collaborate at the same time. The fact that they sell t-shirts designed by people from all over is just an added bonus. Another big draw to the site is the fact that companies can post jobs openings and members of United Pixelworkers can search for available positions. 
	
	In regards to the design of the actual website I thought it might be a little more elaborate being that the founders are web designers. This being said, after checking out the rest of the site I think the design fit well with the overall theme of the website. One thing I noticed is that on the “Roll Call” page the navigation menu that appears on the rest of the pages was absent. I’m a big fan of continuity so when I went to that particular page I expected to see the navigation menu. In general, the United Pixelworkers site is a neat site and embodies several cool aspects. There are also several cool t-shirts designs that I would definitely consider purchasing.
