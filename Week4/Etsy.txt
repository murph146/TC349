	On my initial view of the www.etsy.com website I was somewhat unclear what kind of website or company it was. It appeared to be some kind of store, which was evident from the price tags on the homepage and the title. However there was also a link at the top for selling things. Upon a closer inspection I found out that the site is kind of like eBay, but the items are either handmade, vintage, or a supply. There is a flat rate for listing items and the sellers are primarily businesses and not individual sellers. One of the first things that caught my eye on the homepage was the simple design they used on the homepage. There is not a lot of clutter and little if any outside advertising which makes it easy to focus on the content.

	I liked that there wasn’t a large number of categories to choose from on the main page, which lends itself to the site’s simplicity. Also the majority of the pictures for listed items are extremely vivid. As with most sites I liked seeing the links for Twitter and Facebook in a wide variety of places on the site. There was a separate page for the mobile version of the site and a link to download it on the iTunes App Store. My impression was that its customer base is probably women of different ages and eco-friendly people so it was hard to get interested in the site itself. Overall, the person that built the site did a nice job and I think the design of the site fits the type of business very well.
