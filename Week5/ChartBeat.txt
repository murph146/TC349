The www.chartbeat.com website was one of the cooler sites I have been to recently. I had heard of website that analyze page traffic, but had never actually been to one. The design of the entire site was pretty eye catching and I liked the animated icons that they used. I think breaking up the homepage into different sections about what the site can be used for and listing some of the features that are included was a great idea for promoting the site. Even though it was a small part of the page, I also liked the buttons on the homepage that connected each of the 4 sections together. If I were to add something to the homepage it might be some testimonials of people currently using the service so I could gauge how well other people think its works.  

The fact that you could see a demo of the how the service works was pretty cool too. The use of a dashboard is extremely helpful way of displaying numerous pieces of information in an easy to view display. My issue with the demo page is there was hardly any explanation of the different values and statistics being shown on the sample dashboard so it was hard to understand what was really going on. On a side note, it would have been neat to be able to view traffic for a site of your choosing, instead of just the e-cards website that is shown. Finally, I'm always a fan of free trials so having the option to test out the service through a free 30 day trial was nice to see. Overall, I could definitely see the value in using a service like this to analysis the traffic of website whether a company or personal page.
