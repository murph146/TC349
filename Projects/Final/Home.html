<div class="content"> Welcome to my guide about remote control helicopters. Several years I began to take an interest in learning to build and fly r/c helicopters and have turned it into a personal hobby. I initially got into the r/c hobby back when I was in high school after my parents got me one for Christmas. At the time I didn't even realize how big the r/c industry was and the number of different kinds of r/c devices you can purchase. Now all this talk about r/c toys might have you thinking of the r/c cars or boats you got as a present when you were a kid, but I can assure you these are nothing like that. The majority of these type of helicopters are extremely powerful and have the ability to inflict serious damage on a person or animal if the proper precautions aren't taken.
  Some of the terms used on this website will probably be foreign to you, so please see checkout the glossary of terms link on the next page.
  <h2>Types of R/C Helicopters</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Gas Helicopters</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <ul id="gas">
    <li>Powered by a small engine and nitro fuel </li>
    <li>Typically large in size</li>
    <li>More expensive than electric models</li>
    <li>Primarily for experienced fliers
      </li>
  </ul>
  <ol start="2">
    <li><strong>Electric Helicopters</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <ul id="electric">
    <li>Powered by electric motor and battery</li>
    <li>Most popular</li>
    <li>Prices more reasonable</li>
    <li>Less noise and no fuel to deal with</li>
    <li>More configuration choices (Co-Axil, Fixed, Collective, Mini, Micro) </li>
    <li>Some can be flown indoors</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>R/C Helicopter Configurations</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Co-Axil</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <ul id="co-axil">
    <li>Coaxial helicopters ("co-ax") have two rotors mounted one above the other on a common axis. The rotors rotate in opposite directions, canceling out each other's torque reaction and therefore not requiring a tail rotor.</li>
    <li>Electric coaxial helicopters are the easiest to learn to fly as they are designed to be self-stabilizing to a large extent; when trimmed correctly, if the pilot stops making control inputs, they will tend to return to something resembling a hover. Coupled with their relative robustness it makes coaxial helicopters an excellent inexpensive introduction to helicopter flying, especially for those who do not wish to invest the necessary time to learn to fly a conventional helicopter. The controls are similar enough to larger helicopters to make a coaxial a useful first step for someone with no helicopter experience. </li>
    <li>Electric coaxial helicopters weigh in at from around 50 grams (2 ounces) to 250 grams (9 ounces), and are ideal for flying inside in a good sized room or squash court; they can be flown outside in absolutely still conditions. The low amount of energy stored in the lightweight spinning rotor blades limits the amount of damage that occurs when you crash, both to the helicopter and whatever you crashed into.</li>
  </ul>
  <ol start="2">
    <li><strong>Fixed Pitch</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <ul id="fixed">
    <li>In helicopters generally, a fixed pitch ("FP") design refers to the lack of collective pitch control. Vertical control is achieved by turning the main rotor faster or slower, thus generating more or less lift. Model coaxial helicopters are typically fixed pitch.</li>
    <li> When referring to model helicopters, a fixed pitch helicopter is typically one with a single main rotor and a smaller tail rotor for anti-torque control (also often fixed pitch, and driven by a separate motor). Fixed pitch helicopters have few moving parts; coupled with their light weight (50g (2oz) to 300g (10oz)) they are quite robust to crashes, as long as the throttle is closed before the crash occurs. They can be flown indoors or outside in a very light breeze (1-3mph). </li>
    <li>In undemanding flight, a fixed pitch helicopter flies very similarly to a collective pitch helicopter, making it a useful stepping-stone to a more expensive to buy and run collective pitch machine, but they require substantially more practice to fly than coaxial helicopters.</li>
  </ul>
  <ol start="3">
    <li><strong>Collective Pitch </strong></li>
  </ol>
  <ul id="collective">
    <li>Electric collective pitch helicopters generally start at about 450g (1lb), and the smaller models can be flown indoors in sports halls, but they are really outdoor helicopters, perfect for flying in large empty parks---local regulations permitting. The low mass also reduces the amount of damage done in crashes, and the helicopter can often be back up and running again quickly. The disadvantage of small collective pitch helicopters is that they are strongly affected by wind, limiting the wind they can be comfortably flown in to around 10-15mph. They also tend to have much more sensitive controls than larger helicopters, making them harder to learn to fly.</li>
  </ul>
