  <p> Real quick I wanted to begin by giving you a little background info on the <a href="http://www.myestatemanager.com">My Estate Manager</a> website. The site was built for a company that my dad and a business partner of his created several years ago that deals with various processes involved with estate planning before or after some passes away. The original organization of the site can be seen on the first picture. As with the first exercise I started my organizational review of the My Estate Manager website by creating index cards for the main pages and content within those pages.  One of the very first things I noticed was the repetitiveness of the “find a provider” tool which took up a good amount of space on five of the seven main pages.  Personally I felt that it should only be on the “find a provider” page. This can be seen on the second picture which is of my organization of the site with the changes.</p>
  <p> When I gave the cards to someone else to test see how they would organize the site the results were somewhat different. You can see the way they organized the site in the third picture. In this case they felt that the “find a provider” tool was repetitive as well. They also felt that the “forms library” page could be integrated into the “reference center” page.  Lastly, they felt that the “step-by-step guide” should not be on the homepage and should remain just on the “step-by-step guide” main page. I think both of us took similar approaches to organizing the website, as we did with the <a href="http://foldableme.com/">Foldable Me</a> website. Now that I have more insight on the website's organization I plan on taking some suggestions to my father and the web page administor they use. </p>
