       Surprisingly, this is the first time I have viewed the MSU Mobile website even after spending 5 years at Michigan State University. The only mobile website I have used in regards to MSU is the Angel website due to its popularity among professors.  But as expected the MSU Mobile site is a simple version of the actual MSU website. It’s extremely simple to navigate around and you can access most of the primary features seen on the regular site. One of the coolest things I like about the mobile version is that you are able to customize the icons seen on the homepage. So if there are particular pages you use more than others you can make sure those icons links are easily accessible.
 	Even though it’s not a big deal, it would be nice if the “Events” icon on MSU Mobile site displayed the current date instead of the default “Feb 12” that is being used. Also it would be nice if there was an “Academics” page you could easily access from the MSU Mobile homepage. Being that it’s a university website I would think having a page dedicated to the academic programs available would be a very important piece of content. While having the big “search box” on the mobile site seems helpful, it only seems useful when searching for people and I wasn’t able to find much content using it. Other than that, I like the design of the site and the vertical navigation menus used on many of the pages are easy to scroll through.
