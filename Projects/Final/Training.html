  <h1 align="center">Learning To Fly R/C Helicopters</h1>
  <p> Getting a new r/c helicopter is always exciting and so is being able to put it together. Now if building things is not your forte there are many kits out there that can be purchased pre-built and tuned. Regardless of which option you choose it's important that you spend time learning the basics of flying a helicopter in order to minimize crashes and large repair bills.
