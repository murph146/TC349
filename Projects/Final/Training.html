  Getting a new r/c helicopter is always exciting and so is being able to put it together. Now if building things is not your forte there are many kits out there that can be purchased pre-built and tuned. Regardless of which option you choose it's important that you spend time learning the basics of flying a helicopter in order to minimize crashes and large repair bills. The other thing to keep in mind is that because there are different styles of r/c helicopters, many of them will fly much different than your basic r/c helicopter. As helicopters increase in size and complexity the level of skill needed to master these devices increases considerably. </div>
