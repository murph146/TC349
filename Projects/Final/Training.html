  <p>Getting a new r/c helicopter is always exciting and so is being able to put it together. Now if building things is not your forte there are many kits out there that can be purchased pre-built and tuned. Regardless of which option you choose it's important that you spend time learning the basics of flying a helicopter in order to minimize crashes and large repair bills. The other thing to keep in mind is that because there are different styles of r/c helicopters, many of them will fly much different than your basic r/c helicopter. As helicopters increase in size and complexity the level of skill needed to master these devices increases considerably. </p>
  <p>When it comes to learning to fly an r/c helicopter the key to being successful is lots of practice. It's also important to choose the right helicopter to learn on. Starting on a collective pitch helicopter would be extremely difficult and you'd probably spend more time fixing it than flying it. Your best option will be to start on a co-axil or fixed pitch helicopter. </p>
  <p> One option that will really allow you to learn the basics of flying without paying the inevitable crash is a flight simulator. By hooking up your remote control to your computer you are able to get the feel for the controls and different maneuvers all in a worry-free environment. Depending on the type of helicopter you get, some of the more expensive will come with a free flight simulator. If not, then the one I recommend is <a href="http://www.realflight.com/">RealFlight G6.</a> The software is very life-like and allows you to customize your simulated helicopter or airplane, along with the virtual outdoor flying conditions. The only downside is that it's somewhat expensive at around $200. In the long run, spending a good amount of time will on the flight simulator will probably save you at least $200 on the inevitable crashes that come with learning to fly an r/c helicopter.</p>
