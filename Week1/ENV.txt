	For my environment I decide to go with DreamWeaver right from the start. Over the past couple semesters I have taken several courses with were based around different Adobe programs and I was able to gain a lot of hands on experience with the software itself. The one in particular that stoodout was Adobe Flash which allowed use to create applications and different animations, among other things. Being that in TC 349 we will be greating a website I was hoping to use DreamWeaver because I have had it installed for awhile, but have only used it minimally. From my understandig though DreamWeaver is one of Adobe's programs that is looked highly upon when it comes to writing code. Being that I am graduating in Decemeber with a Media and Communications Technology degree, I think its vital to be able to create a web page on your own. My goal is to become more proficient with the software throughout the semster so when the class is over I have a good grip on it and can take that experience to an upcoming job. 
	As far as the setup of DreamWeaver goes, I havent really changed any settings. As you can see from the screenshot, I took a picture of the code for the "Hello World" page and then change the color of the font and back ground color to match the classic Michigan State Spartans colors. In order to become more proficent with DreamWeaver I have been going through some basic tutorials on the many functions and options within the program. However, I think if I'm really going to understand the program well and make the most use of it, that I will look for a book similar to what i used for Adobe Flash. What was nice about the book for Adobe Flash was it was very detailed, had a lot of screenshots, and it walked you through numerous tasks within the software. Overall, I'm looking to get as much as possible out of this class and hope to be able to create a nice webpage when the class is said and done.
