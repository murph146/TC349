 As you can see from the picture on this page one of hobbies is riding sport bikes. The picture to the right is a 2012 Suzuki GSX R600, which is the bike I plan on getting next spring. The first bike I ever owned was a 250cc Kawasaki Ninja which I purchased during my freshman year of college. Unfortunately the experience did not end well due to the fact that the barn I was storing my bike in catching on fire one night. Regardless, I have always enjoyed going fast and feeling the freedom that comes with riding a sport bike. </p>

<p>While riding a sport bike can be dangerous, so are a number of the other hobbies I enjoy. After sport bikes my next favorite hobby would be flying single-engine planes. I initially started training for my private pilots license after graduating from high school and was able to excel at this quickly. In order to get your private pilots license you need a minimum of 50 hours of flight time and must complete several solo flights, night flights, and cross-country flights by yourself. Due to work and college I have not yet been able to complete my training, but I hope to in the near future. Below is a list of some of my other favorite hobbies and sports I enjoy playing.</p>
