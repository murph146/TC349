<p> <img src="images/016.jpg" height="200" width="250" align="right" class="wrapped"> Hi, my name is Rob Murphy and the reason I created this site is to give you a closer look at who I am and some of the things I enjoy doing. I am currently a senior at Michigan State University and will be graduating this December with a degree in Media and Communications Technology (MCT). Along with my degree I also chose to specialize in Information and Communication Tecnhology (ICT).  I have broken the site down into several different areas and they are as follows:
<ul>
  <li><a href="Portfolio.html">My Portfolio</a></li>
  <li><a href="Hobbies.html">Hobbies</a></li>
  <li><a href="Destinations.html">Favorite Destinations</a></li>
</ul>
If you would like more information on the degree I am currently finishing you can visit the <a href="www.msu.edu"> MSU Website</a> and if you have any questions for me feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:murph146@msu.edu?subject=Feedback" >Murph146@msu.edu</a> </p>
