	Upon viewing the Happy Cog website I got the impression that it was unique compared to a typical website. One of the firs things I noticed was that the main navigation buttons didn’t take you to separate webpages. Instead when you click on one of the buttons it takes you to the relevant section within the homepage. While I have seen this type of webpage before, it doesn’t seem to fit the typical mold where the site is divided up into several main pages. It seemed like due to this choice of navigation they were limited to the amount of information they could provide on the hompage. 
	The other thing I noticed about this site is that it seemed like they were boasting a bit. A lot of information on the main page contained their accolades and awards, enough that it stood out. I’m all for this type of promoting, but at the same time they could have replaced some of this information with stuff relating to the service they provide or other relevant material. Other than that, I liked the design of the site and it was easy to get around. Based on what I saw and the success of the companies they have worked with I would definitely feel comfortable using their service.
