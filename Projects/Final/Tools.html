  Once you choose the type of helicopter you want it will be important that you have a basic toolkit. Whether your at home or out flying having these tools with you will save you a lot of time and get you back out flying quickly. It's also important that you keep these tools organized and together because many of them are much smaller than a typical version. This is due to the fact that when working with most r/c devices the nuts, bolts, and screws are quite small.

Above are what I would consider the four most important types of tools to have when working on an remote control helicopter. However, these are just the tools I feel are necessary for getting started and building a basic toolkit. From left to right, the tools above are as follows: assorted mini pliers, allen wrenches, digital multi-meter, and assorted screw drivers. As you try out different helicopters or even other types of r/c devices these tools will come in very handy. Many of the big manufacturers use identical screws, nuts, and bolts so having these tools around is key. As you become more involved in the hobby there are a number of other tools youâ€™ll want to invest in and I had listed them on the right.
  <p> While you can probably find most of these tools at your local hobby shop or hardware store, I prefer getting them from a site called <a href="http://www.hobbypartz.com">HobbyPartz.com.</a> This website has a wide assortment of r/c helicopters, accessories, and tools, as well as quick shipment. A number of the big r/c helicopter vendors are located internationally and getting parts can be difficult to find, so the that fact that HobbyPartz is located in the U.S. is a huge selling point.</p>

The next step will be to decide what kind you want and then purchase it.
