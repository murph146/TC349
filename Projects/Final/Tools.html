    <h1>Tools Needed For Building & Maintenance</h1>
    <P>Once you choose the type of helicopter you want it will be important that you have a basic toolkit. Whether your at home or out flying having these tools with you will save you a lot of time and get you back out flying quickly. It's also important that you keep these tools organized and together because many of them are much smaller than a typical verison. This is due to the fact that when working with most r/c devices the nuts, bolts, and screws are quite small.
